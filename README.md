## 😞 I ran this app, and I have an issue ...

Well first of all this app is signed so you have to use your own `key.properties` file with a reference to your own `upload-keystore.jks` file. Either you can do all that (which would be a good learning exercise for beginners) or you can copy paste the 2 files into your lib folder.

Other than this, if you have anything, just open an issue and I'll love to help!
